		<i>a / s / l ???</i> is a website which allows you to anonymously share your age, sex, and location (however you may interpret it) with other users. Upon sharing, you will see the a/s/l of everyone who shared before you. You can share as many times as you want—cool! You may like this site if you like AIM, guestbooks, or writing your initials in wet cement. You may not like it if you like Facebook, business meetings, or targeted advertisements. This site was conceived and designed by <a href="http://www.desaturate.net/" target="_blank">Will Baker</a>. It was developed by Sheldon Lessard.
